\chapter{Release notes 发行说明}

This book is a \LaTeX{} version of the notes published by me on GitHub (and other open-source code hosting platforms), which also conform to the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. Compared to that, apart from typographic differences, there are only minor changes to certain words, to correct mistakes, to maintain consistancies over different notes or to clarify the original content.
